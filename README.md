# ProKhelo_Assignement
I created this assignment using Java and Springboot  also used Hibernate to interact with the database.
Used MySQL database to store the users details in the USERS table aslo defined the Configuration of database in  the application properties file.
I defined all the methods in the contoller class for the following APIs.
1. Login of the user (using email and password)
2. User can create his profile.
3. User can edit his profile (the parameters that you took while
creating the user profile)
4. Get all the users from the API
